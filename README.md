## Overview

This project provides a straightforward solution to convert `.md` (Markdown) files into `.html` files. It can be used for generating static websites, documentation, or any content that starts as Markdown.

## Features
- Convert Markdown files into HTML with proper formatting.
- Supports standard Markdown syntax (headings, lists, links, images, etc.).
- Generates clean and responsive HTML output.
- Simple CLI (Command Line Interface) for easy integration into projects.
- Configurable options for HTML structure (e.g., custom title, body class, etc.).

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are required. If you don’t have them installed, you can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markdown-to-html.git
    cd markdown-to-html
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

You can use this tool in two ways: through the command line interface (CLI) or as a library in your Node.js application.

### Command Line Interface

After installation, you can use the tool directly from the command line. To convert a Markdown file into HTML:

```bash
node index.js path/to/your-file.md
```

This will generate an HTML file with the same name as the Markdown file in the current directory.

You can also specify an output file:

```bash
node index.js path/to/your-file.md -o output.html
```

### Programmatic Usage

You can also integrate this project into your own Node.js application. Here's an example:

```javascript
const mdToHtml = require('markdown-to-html');
const fs = require('fs');

const markdownContent = fs.readFileSync('input.md', 'utf-8');
const htmlContent = mdToHtml(markdownContent);

fs.writeFileSync('output.html', htmlContent);
```

## Command Line Options

- `-o` or `--output` : Specify the output HTML file (default is the same as the input file name).
- `-h` or `--help` : Show the help message.

```bash
node index.js --help
```
